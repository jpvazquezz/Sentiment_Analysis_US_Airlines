# Sentiment_Analysis_US_Airlines

In this repository, we pratice some sentiment analysis creating models based on different classification algorithms - Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Machine (SVM). For this purpose, we use the US Airlines dataset that consists of extracted tweets containing sentiment content towards the airlines companies. 

The repository contains:
* Sentiment_Analysis_US_Airlines.ipynb- the notebook with Exploratory Data Analysis and the machine learing modelling
* Tweets.csv - csv file containing the tweets
* database.sqlite -  the database with the tweets
* sentiment_analysis.py - python file contains directly the machine leaning modelling
